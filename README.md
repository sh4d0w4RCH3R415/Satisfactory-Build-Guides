## Satisfactory-Build-Guides
A simple application that shows different videos from [Satisfactory Tips](https://www.satisfactorytips.com).

### Need-To-Know Info
 - I will try to update the application regulary to match up with the website's building guides.
 - If I'm behind, it's most likely that I'm doing something else at the moment.
 - The UI will *almost always* be the same, and I will *almost never* change it.
 - If you want something added, there's a ***10% chance*** I'll add it.
 - I will not optimize this application, for it is purely a **video player** for ***Satisfactory Build Guides***.

### How To Use
1. Go to the DropDown menu next to the "Build Guide:" label.
2. Choose one of the available selections.
3. Wait for the video to load in the bottom panel.
4. Click PLAY on the video!
5. You've successfully used ***Satisfactory Build Guides***!
